# API's use in this project

I need some help, that is why I work with three API's to make this project come to life. <br> API's use were:

-[JavaScript Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)<br>
-[Open Cage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com/)<br>
-[Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)<br>

# Compatibility
If you access to the web on Brave Browser, there could be some issues. Because, Brave browser does not run geolocation API, well for now that's what I know.

Moreover, you need to enable GPS on your phone and computer to run the web correctly.

On Mozilla Firefox, if I am not mistaken, it does not has compatibility with the background blur property on CSS3. I am going to fix this problem on the following days or weeks.
